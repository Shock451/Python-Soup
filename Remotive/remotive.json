Achieving these goals will be challenging, but we know we can do it.

We will take all of the amazing and painful experiences of the past and apply them to create a company we all will be very proud of.\n  </div>\n  <div>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n   <span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">\n    Self-funded\n   </span>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n   The founders have invested $10 million to allow us to focus on building technology and product the right way.

We are laser focused on customer needs, but will make product priorities based on our long-term goals, not short-term revenue.\n  </div>\n  <div>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n   <span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">\n    Remote-first\n   </span>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n   We believe technology that enables remote work to be\n   <em>\n    better\n   </em>\n   than a corporate office setting is already here and the world of business is just about to catch up. Remote work certainly comes with drawbacks, but the strongly believe the advantages vastly outnumber the disadvantages. Speaking to dozens of experienced remote employees has shown us that the number one obstacle to building a successful remote workplace is doing it half-way by having some people be co-located and some remote. We want the same mode of collaboration for\n   <em>\n    everyone\n   </em>\n   and our team will be working remotely most of the time.\n  </div>\n  <div>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n   This does not mean that you have to work from home all the time, or at all. Motiion will pay for co-working space if that\u2019s what you prefer. We will also encourage team members that live in the same area to meet up and work together when it makes sense. We will also make sure we all meet regularly for real in-person interaction!\n  </div>\n  <div>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n   <span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">\n    Personal impact of collaborating individuals\n   </span>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n   We have seen first-hand how corporate culture can devolve into empire building and reporting lines. Motiion will have great managers, but we recognize and value the skills of individual contributors. You can grow your career at Motiion doing the work you love and excel at. Your merit matters, not your title.\n  </div>\n  <div>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n   <span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">\n    Benefits\n   </span>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n   We have top notch benefits, matching most of the large US tech companies, including 401k matching, excellent health insurance and a generous vacation policy.\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>",

You will work closely with our application software developers and management to plan and implement the future of the certificate authority, its software applications, and its policies and procedures.\n </p>\n <p style=\"font-family: Nunito, sans-serif; font-size: 17.6px;\">\n  We provide secure and reliable service to more than 150 million websites around the world. We expect this number to grow rapidly. As such it\u2019s a unique opportunity to have an enormous impact on creating a more secure and privacy-respecting Web.\n </p>\n <p style=\"font-family: Nunito, sans-serif; font-size: 17.6px;\">\n  In some organizations, the people responsible for deploying applications are left out of the full application development lifecycle. They are simply handed something at the end and told \u201cmake this run reliably, securely, and efficiently\u201d while the infrastructure management role is devalued or taken for granted. That is not how we do things at Let\u2019s Encrypt. SRE is part of the application development lifecycle from start to finish and we heavily invest in enabling and building infrastructure that is reliable, secure, and efficient. SRE is given latitude, time, and resources to do things The Right Way.\n </p>\n <p style=\"font-family: Nunito, sans-serif; font-size: 17.6px;\">\n  Automation is central to everything you and your team will build and maintain. You will automate operations extensively for the sake of security, scalability, correctness, compliance, and financial efficiency. You will make sure that when something does need to be done manually, it can be done in a safe and efficient manner. Our focus on automation means we are particularly interested in candidates with software engineering skills.\n </p>\n <p style=\"font-family: Nunito, sans-serif; font-size: 17.6px;\">\n  Our physical infrastructure includes servers, storage, switches, firewalls, and HSMs deployed across two highly secure data centers. While the majority of our infrastructure runs on our own hardware, we do use external cloud and CDN providers for some peripheral systems.\n </p>\n <p style=\"font-family: Nunito, sans-serif; font-size: 17.6px;\">\n  We use open source software (e.g. Linux, Prometheus, Grafana, SaltStack) extensively and prefer it when it can get the job done. The\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder\" style=\"color: rgb(55, 113, 200);\">\n   core CA application software\n  </a>\n  that your team will be responsible for deploying is open source and written by our software development team.\n </p>\n <p style=\"font-family: Nunito, sans-serif; font-size: 17.6px;\">\n  Effective engineers know how to properly prioritize and communicate well.

You don\u2019t need to know these languages coming in but you will need to learn them.\n </p>\n <p style=\"font-family: Nunito, sans-serif; font-size: 17.6px;\">\n  You will need to develop systems and network administration skills if you haven\u2019t already. This means, for example, learning to manage firewalls and routers, work with automation tools like SaltStack, and manage virtual machines on both physical and cloud infrastructure.\n </p>\n <p style=\"font-family: Nunito, sans-serif; font-size: 17.6px;\">\n  You will need to gain domain-specific knowledge (e.g. PKI) but you don\u2019t need to know it coming in.\n </p>\n <h2 style=\"font-family: Nunito, sans-serif; font-weight: 500; line-height: 1.3; color: rgb(52, 58, 64); font-size: 2rem;\">\n  Location and Benefits\n </h2>\n <p style=\"font-family: Nunito, sans-serif; font-size: 17.6px;\">\n  This is a remote position available anywhere in the United States or Canada.\n </p>\n <p style=\"font-family: Nunito, sans-serif; font-size: 17.6px;\">\n  Benefits include excellent health insurance, a 100% match for 401k contributions, and flexible time off and parental leave policies.\n </p>\n</div>",

Regardless of how well you feel you fit our description, we encourage you to apply if:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You care deeply about improving frontend technology so our customers can have a great experience using our product.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <strong>\n     About You\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <strong>\n     You love code.\n    </strong>\n    You love to take raw ideas and build great products with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You know JavaScript is imperfect, but you embrace its functional side and genuinely enjoy coding with it. You might like to talk about obscure computer science topics, but really, you just want to write simple code and ship new products and features to customers (or improve existing ones).\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <strong>\n     You love great UX.\n    </strong>\n    You spend most of your time coding, but you also have an eye for great design and a feel for great UX. Maybe you were once a designer (or still are) or maybe your creative outlet has always been the code. Either way, you care about more than\n    <em>\n     just\n    </em>\n    the code.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <strong>\n     You love learning new things.\n    </strong>\n    You love researching new tech and driving forward with the implementation details. Your focus is on frontend JavaScript code, but you can dig in wherever needed. Python, CSS, build tools, shell scripts, you name it. If you don't already know it, you're ready to learn it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <strong>\n     You can balance lots of concerns.\n    </strong>\n    Frontend apps have to take into account performance (using networks and devices that we can't control), customer demands, A/B tests, UX research, code quality, a rapidly changing ecosystem of languages and modules, and the list goes on. And we actually want to ship things too! You can balance those demands without getting overwhelmed and keep the needle moving forward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <strong>\n     You love helping others.\n    </strong>\n    You love sharing knowledge with the rest of your team, building shared tooling for other engineers, giving back to the open-source community, and directly helping customers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <strong>\n     Things You Might Do\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Zapier is a small, fast-growing, and remote-first company, so you'll likely get experience on many different projects across the organization. That said, here are some things you'll probably do:\n   </p>\n   <ul>\n    <li>\n     Research, guide, and execute frontend architecture changes, including but by no means limited to GraphQL, server-side React rendering, and Flow typing.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     Build reusable React components with modular CSS, manage data on the client with Redux and GraphQL, and test everything with Jest.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     Measure and resolve performance bottlenecks, using tools like Chrome DevTools, Lighthouse, WebPagetest, or custom tooling.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     Refactor or improve existing code. We've migrated most of our frontend to React, but we still have some Backbone code to clean up. And we constantly find ways to improve all of our JavaScript code.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     Work closely with our product, design, and UX teams to create amazing and intuitive experiences that make it effortless to connect different apps together.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     Help put tools, processes, and documentation in place to improve our code quality.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     Review code written by other team members or other teams.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     Ship to hundreds of thousands of users every day while having lots of autonomy in terms of code and feature ownership.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     Work with complex and varied data structures (APIs can be a little, uh, eccentric).\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     Help out with our Python backend or Node-based developer platform.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     Share what you know and learn either one-on-one or with lightning talks to the group.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     Give back to the community via open source and blog posts.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     Experiment: this is a startup so everything can change as we experiment with doing more custom partnership work\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     As a part of Zapier's\u00a0all-hands philosophy, help customers via support to ensure they have the best experience possible.\n    </li>\n   </ul>\n   <p>\n    You\u2019ll also have the opportunity to specialize in a variety of areas of the Zapier codebase, including core product or platform development. Focusing on a specialization will not limit your area for growth at Zapier as each engineer brings a unique perspective and can contribute differently in all areas. We encourage participation and will frequently have engineers contribute across teams to assist in projects.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <strong>\n     About Zapier\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the past six years, Zapier has been helping people across the world automate the boring and tedious parts of their job.

You\u0092ll also need to be visually oriented with experience in Sketch or Photoshop and a good understanding of content organization and concepts within information architecture.
