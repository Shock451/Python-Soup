As every company in the world is becoming a software company, and as software delivery practices evolve from slow, infrequent releases toward continuous delivery supported by CI/CD, DevOps practices and the cloud, this new software category will become the most mission critical new business system in the modern enterprise. As today\u2019s clear leader in CI/CD, CloudBees is uniquely positioned to define and lead this new category and is expanding its product and engineering organization in order to do so.\n </p>\n <p>\n  CloudBees was founded in 2010 by FOSS veterans from JBoss and RedHat and became the home of Enterprise Jenkins when they joined forces with Kohsuke Kawaguchi, CloudBees\u2019 CTO today and the inventor of Jenkins. Jenkins is the world\u2019s most widely deployed, flexible and capable CI/CD software platform, with 1,700,000 known installations and a vibrant developer ecosystem of over 1,400 plugins.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Since its founding CloudBees has grown to serve over 500 customers of its Jenkins-based enterprise-grade CI/CD software solutions. It has recently acquired a leading vendor of CI/CD-as-a-service, Codeship, to broaden the options it provides to the market. CloudBees is now rapidly expanding this offering to include innovative new capabilities for software delivery governance, visibility and insights, while also quickly evolving its architecture to take advantage of the latest cloud delivery technologies and practices. These new capabilities are being integrated into a new end-to-end system, The CloudBees Suite.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The CloudBees product and engineering organization includes some of the world\u2019s most respected contributors to the tools, languages and practices behind modern software development. Because CloudBees is a fully distributed company, it\u2019s also been able to draw on a global talent pool and maintain a very high bar for intellect, technical skills and work culture. Nearly every Bee has chosen to work at CloudBees because of a personal conviction of the transformative power of continuous delivery practices in every function in software development, and every Bee has been actively chosen for being amongst the best at what they do in the world.

Jilt is built as a traditional Rails 5.2 app, with Postgres &amp; Elasticsearch for persistence, and Sidekiq for background jobs. We use Angular (v1) to power our visual email editor and Vue.js for some areas with a lot of dynamic content, and are actively replacing both with React, so you\u2019ll be able to help architect the APIs that will drive those new interfaces.\n </p>\n <p>\n  While the majority of your time will be spent working on backend systems &amp; features, you\u2019ll also have the opportunity to work on various front-end systems, like fixing a bug with our email editor, replacing a legacy Slim template with a React view, or adding a new feature to our storefront JS.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As one of our senior engineers, the team will look to you for advice and direction. You\u2019ll help shape our best practices, decide on libraries &amp; tooling, and refactor older or underperforming parts of the codebase.

You prefer writing Ruby, but are comfortable in JavaScript or picking up other languages (like Go or PHP) as needed. You have deep experience working with Rails and all of its libraries and know when to roll a custom solution to a problem or use a gem. You\u2019ve worked with Sidekiq or a similar background processing system, and understand the subtle but important guidelines to follow when architecting performant, fault-tolerant background workers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You also love data and working with complex queries in SQL, whether as part of ActiveRecord or on the console. You have experience with Elasticsearch, or are excited to learn it, and are interested in the challenges involved with keeping separate datastores in sync. You love keeping up-to-date with the latest best practices and tools, and are constantly tweaking and improving the way you work. You know how to operate a hydraulic press, or least watched a YouTube video about them and think they\u2019re totally rad.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You\u2019re excited to solve engineering challenges in the most pragmatic way possible, and most importantly, you keep the end user in mind and love getting feedback from customers to help improve our products.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Finally, you can\u2019t wait to join a small team that loves their work as much as you do, affords the opportunity to work on challenging &amp; interesting projects, continuously learn and improve, and constantly ship your work. You\u2019re an excellent writer and can communicate effectively whether drafting up a bug report, chatting in Slack, editing a wiki page, or drafting a retrospective. You know that code is about communication and explaining your thought process clearly goes hand-in-hand.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Our team is fully-remote\n  </strong>\n  and we communicate primarily through Slack, Clubhouse, Google Docs, Basecamp, and weekly stand-ups via Zoom (a few short meetings) \u2014 we believe the best work happens when given lots of uninterrupted time that\u2019s free of distractions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   As a remote team\n  </strong>\n  , we believe that regular meetups are invaluable for getting to know each other better, so you should be available for 1-2 company-paid team trips per year. Curious about what those are like? Check out our recap of our last team retreat (SkyTrip), which brought the entire team out to Lake Tahoe, California for a week. It\u2019s a plus if you think (like we do) that bears are absolutely the coolest animals in the forest.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is a full-time, salaried position, but hours are flexible. We know your work will speak for itself with commits, issues closed, and wiki edits.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   PROCESS\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  After an initial screening, you\u2019ll get an email with a few questions to answer. Following that, you\u2019ll have a few 45 minute phone chats with different people on our team to learn more about you and answer any questions you have about the position and company.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The most qualified candidates will then be invited to complete a short one-day research project. If this goes well, we\u2019ll invite you to the final stage of our evaluation process: the trial project. During this ~2 week period, you\u2019ll work closely with your future manager, as well as a few other team members, as a paid contractor to implement your proposal from the research project. You\u2019ll be welcomed in Slack, introduced to any team members you may be working with, and will have regular chats with your future manager to share feedback and make sure all is going well. Already working full time? Don\u2019t worry! We design the trial project assuming someone already has a full time job. We won\u2019t ask you to work crazy hours, and we keep your project scoped accordingly. This brief trial period is a great way for you to make sure you enjoy the work and the team, and it also gives us an opportunity to do the same.
